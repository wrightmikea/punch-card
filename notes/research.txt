IBM punch cards have a corner cut off, but some online images show it to be the top left corner and other show the top right corner cut off. Why? Which approach did IBM branded cards use (one or both? which one?). Also, can you find documentation on the specifications for the space between each edge and where a punch hole should be? (top, left, right, and bottom)

Here are the answers to your questions about IBM punch cards.

The Corner Cut: Top-Left vs. Top-Right
The difference you're seeing is almost always a matter of perspective.

IBM's Standard: The industry standard, set by IBM for their 80-column card, was a single cut in the top-left corner.

The "Top-Right" View: The images showing a "top-right" cut are almost certainly showing the back of the card. If you take a standard top-left cut card and flip it over horizontally, the cut will appear to be in the top-right.

The entire purpose of the cut was for orientation. By ensuring all cards in a deck had their cut in the same corner, an operator could instantly see (and feel) if any cards were upside-down or backward, as that card's corner would "stick out" from the rest of the deck.

While the top-left cut was the dominant IBM standard, it's possible that extremely early cards or cards from other, less-common manufacturers (like Remington Rand) had different standards, but for the classic IBM system, top-left (when viewing the printed front) is the correct answer.

Punch Hole Specifications (Margins)
The specifications for the standard IBM 80-column card (defined by standards like ANSI X3.21-1967) are very precise. The margins are measured from the physical edge of the card to the centerline of the first or last row/column of holes.

The overall card dimensions are 7

Here are the standard margin specifications:

Top Margin: 0.250 inches (6.35 mm)

(From the top edge to the center of the 12-row, which is the top-most punch row).

Bottom Margin: 0.250 inches (6.35 mm)

(From the bottom edge to the center of the 9-row, which is the bottom-most punch row).

Left Margin: 0.342 inches (8.69 mm)

(From the left edge to the center of Column 1).

Right Margin: 0.342 inches (8.69 mm)

(From the right edge to the center of Column 80).

So if I were to punch EBCDIC source code, e.g. IBM 1130 Assembler, to a punch card and then store that 80 byte record to disk, it would fit in 80 bytes, right? If I ran an IBM 1130 assembler program and it produced an object deck, and each card it punched was a binary card, and then I copied one of those cards to a binary disk file, it would also be 80 bytes, right?

You've hit on a fascinating and tricky detail of the IBM 1130. Your assumption is correct for the EBCDIC card, but not for the binary card, which used a special, denser format.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. EBCDIC Source Code Card (e.g., Assembler)
Yes, this would fit in 80 bytes.

Format: A standard source code card was an "EBCDIC card" or "character card."

Mapping: Each of the 80 columns on the card represented a single 8-bit EBCDIC character.

Storage: When a utility copied this card to disk, it created a "card image" file. This file had a fixed logical record length of 80 bytes (or 40 16-bit words, as the 1130 was a 16-bit machine). Each byte in the disk record corresponded directly to one column on the card.

2. Binary Object Deck Card
No, this would be stored as a 108-byte record.

This is the non-intuitive part. The 1130 Assembler did not produce 80-byte binary "images." It produced highly efficient, compressed binary cards to speed up loading.

Format: This was known as an "IBM 1130 Binary Card" or, informally, a "Zebra Stripe Card" (due to the dense, striped look of the punches).

Mapping: This format completely ignored the 80-column character concept. Instead, it used 72 of the 80 columns in a special way:

It read all 12 rows in each of the 72 columns (72×12=864 punch positions, or 864 bits).

This 864-bit block of data was then reformatted by the card reader hardware/software into 54 16-bit words.

Storage: Since the IBM 1130 was a 16-bit (2-byte) machine, 54 words is 54×2=108 bytes.

So, when the assembler punched an object deck, each card contained 108 bytes of binary program data. When you copied that "binary card" to a "binary disk file" (like an object file), you were storing that 108-byte (54-word) logical record, not an 80-byte image.
